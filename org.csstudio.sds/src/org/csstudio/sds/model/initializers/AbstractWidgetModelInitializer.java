	 * reference to this schema is assigned.
	 * 
	 * Subclasses can use the following methods for initialization of a widget:
	 * 
	 * {@link #initializeDynamicProperty(String, String)}
	 * {@link #initializeDynamicProperty(String, String[])}
	 * {@link #initializeDynamicProperty(String, String, String, String)}
	 * {@link #initializeAlias(String, String)}
	 * {@link #initializeStaticProperty(String, Object)}
	 * 
	 * A typical implementation might look like this:
	 * 
	 * <code>
	 * 	protected void initialize(final AbstractControlSystemSchema schema) {
	 * 		initializeStaticProperty(RectangleModel.PROP_FILL, 50.0);
	 * 		initializeDynamicProperty(RectangleModel.PROP_FILL, "$channel$.VAL");
	 *  }
	 * </code>
	 * 
	 * @param schema
	 *            the control system schema
