This plugin is single sourced meaning that it is used in the same version in the RAP and SWT Dawn products.

This means that imports such as org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.draw2d are package imports.
It also means that constructors to classes like Cursor which do not have an equivalent in RAP 
are called using reflection and allowed to fail in the RAP product.
