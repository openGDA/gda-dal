<h3><code>org.csstudio.sds.cosywidgets.ui.internal.utils.ShadedDrawing</code></h3>

<p>The purpose of this class initially was to provide utility functions to do shaded drawing, i.e. 3D loking lines, arcs, ...
This, however, proved to be a little too time consuming to make, so only one utility remained:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>drawLineAtAngle</code> draws the given line as a line segment, defined by a center, two radii from the center
(the difference of which is the actual length) and an angle.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the widgets will ever be modified to have a 3D appearance, the helper functions to achieve this should be
put into this class.</p>
