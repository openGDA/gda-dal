<h3><code>org.csstudio.sds.cosywidgets.ui.internal.utils.Trigonometry</code></h3>

<p>The purpose of this class is to speed up trigonometric calculation by utilizing a lookup table.<br/>
The static initialization block prepares a table for the sin and cos functions, in degrees and with a step of 1/100 of a degree.</p>

<p>If any other functions, that are time-consuming to compute, are needed in real-time drawing code, they should be
added into this class and precomputed into a table.</p>
