/**
 * Interface <code>DynamicValueMonitor</code> defines the way in which an observer
 * (realized as JavaBeans listener) can influence the flow of events from the
 * data access event source. Subscription can be changed by each observer separately
 * and it affects that observer only. Event delivery is changed by changing characteristics
 * in the characteristic context of the subscription.
 * <p>
 * Timer trigger is the only statically declared trigger in this interface; implementations
 * may choose to provide additional triggers through the characteristic context.
 * Timer trigger may operate at the prescribed default frequency, with all other (optional)
 * triggers set to their respective default values. In this case the method
 * <code>isDefault</code> must return <code>true</code>. The default subscription may be
 * handled separately (in a more efficient way) by the underlying implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Datatypes library does not link this interface explicitely from any other interface.
 * In this way the implementation is free to choose how it will offer subscription control
 * and whether it will offer it at all. If there is no subscription control, the same
 * events must be dispatched to all listeners, as in JavaBeans specification.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Methods of this interface which generate transient connection objects such as requests and
 * responses, store those objects directly into the latest values of the property to
 * which this monitor belongs. For example, if changing trigger thorugh this method generates
 * a request the request will be accessible through the <code>AbstractProperty</code>
 * <code>Updateable</code> interface.
 * </p>
