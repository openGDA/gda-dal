/**
 * This interface contains methods that access the set of transient objects generated
 * by the underlying implementation when the dynamic value is queried. What these
 * transient objects contain depends on the implementation. The implementation - in
 * case the query does not require any transient objects, such as completion codes,
 * requests, responses, error codes etc - may return <code>null</code>. The access
 * to these objects <b>must be thread local</b>. For details, see the documentation
 * of <code>java.lang.ThreadLocal</code>. In short, this requirement means that the
 * returned values are different for different threads that invoke these methods. The
 * "last request" is defined as being the last that has been invoked from the caller's
 * thread.
 * <p>
 * A dynamic value can be accessed in different ways, either by subscriptions (observer
 * pattern) or by direct invocation of <code>get</code> methods. An instance of
 * <code>ValueUpdateable</code> must store the value, when accessed by any means, with the
 * latest timestamp as provided by the underlying implementation (or, if the underlying
 * implementation does not provide timestamped data, with the latest local timestamp), in
 * the <code>latestReceivedValueAsObject</code>. The <code>latestValueChangeTimestamp</code>
 * and <code>latestValueUpdateTimestamp</code> reflect the times, when the value last
 * changed and when the underlying implementation last confirmed that the value is still the
 * same, respectivelly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is implemented by all objects that allow access to the dynamic value.
