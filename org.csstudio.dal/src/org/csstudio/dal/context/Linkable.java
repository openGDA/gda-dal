/**
 * <code>Linkable</code> interface represents the object that can report state of its

 * by itself. Thus, <code>Linkable</code> must be initialized by another
 * object that establishes a connection (in final instance, this is always the
 * <code>Connectable</code>).
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Linkable</code> defines no state except
 * the distinction between the state in which there is a link to remote and a
 * state in which there isn't one. There is no distinction as for the reason
 * why the link was lost or established. If the <code>Linkable</code> is
 * unable to execute the request because it is in invalid state (for example
 * if it is not yet initialized but <code>resume</code> is called), it should
 * quietly ignore the request (it can generate a notification, but must not
 * throw an exception). A failed request should be signaled by an exception. A
 * state distinction between suspended / resumed state can exist only if the
 * <code>Linkable</code> is in link established state.
