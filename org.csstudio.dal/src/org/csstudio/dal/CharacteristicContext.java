/**
 * A <code>CharacteristicContext</code> represents a collection of characteristics.
 * Characteristics are name - value pairs that are considered static in time compared
 * to dynamic value changes. The changes in characteristic values are possible, but happen
 * mostly due to maintainance reasons (changes in values in static databases and so on).
 * The characteristics can be statically declared as JavaBeans properties or they can be
 * completely dynamic, accessible during run-time with their string name key.
 * These generic methods offer narrow access to all (dynamic and statically declared)
 * characteristics. All changes in characteristic values should be announced by
 * beans property change events. Sometimes new characteristics may become available
 * during the lifecycle of the characteristic context (while they may be unavailable from
 * the beginning). This applies to characteristic values as well as for the list of
 * characteristic names. An implementation can, however, guarantee to make available a list
 * of names and values at a certain well-defined time moment in the implementation life cycle.
 * This is a design decision of the implementation and should be well documented. An example
 * would be a context that binds to a remote server: here, characteristic values would be
 * available when the connection completes successfully.
 * A characteristic, however, may not become unavailable after it
 * has become available (i.e. after its name becomes known, it has to exist in the context
 * for the life time of the context; but of course its value may change to uninitialized
 * value).
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may decide to buffer the characteristic values if
 * it is known in advance that the values will not change and the primary data source
 * is remote.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An existing characteristic with initialized value <b>must not</b> have a <code>null</code>
 * value.
 * </p>
