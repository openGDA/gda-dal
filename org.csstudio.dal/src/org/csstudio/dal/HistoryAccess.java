/**
 * This interface is implemented by entities that are able to return history data.
 * History data are data value - timestamp pairs. The support for accessing such
 * data is very versatile by means of history iterators that control the access to the
 * data items, if there are a large number of them; and by means of
 * <code>HistoryConstraints</code> instances that determine, before the data are accessed
 * from a (potentially) remote source, what selection rules to use for the data. Note that
 * history iterators and accessors are not useful only for dynamic values, they might also
 * be used to iterate over (for example) events, if the data source supports such
 * iteration.
