/**
 * Instances of classes implementing this interface allow the user to traverse history data.
 * Specializations of this interface provide typed data access. History iterators are bulk
 * iterators: they iterate by returning chunks of history data in prescribed sizes, determined
 * by parameter passed to the <code>next()</code> method. This is useful if the amount of data,
 * returned (or estimated by) <code>size()</code> is very large. By doing chunk iteration,
 * the display components can retrieve and display parts of history at the time.
 * The implementation of this interface is not restriced to the <code>AbstractProperty</code>
 * types; every object capable of delivering history data can return instances of
 * <code>HistoryIterator</code> implementations.
 * <b>Note: if you want to specify the size of the fist chunk (after the iterator has been
 * constructed, you have to call <code>next()</code> before you call either timestamp accessing
 * or data accessing method, in a similar way to Java SQL <code>ResultSet</code>). If you don't
 * call <code>next()</code> after the iterator is created, the data accessing methods will transfer
 * the whole history in one go.
 * </b>
 * <p>
 * The ordering of elements returned in the iterators is <b>always</b> from the latest history
 * entry (as defined by its timestamp) towards elements with smaller timestamps. This is
 * implemented because displayers can render the most recent (and probably more important) data
 * first. As well, the iteration may not be completed if enough data items have been received
 * by Datatypes user.
 * </p>
